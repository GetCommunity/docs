# On Asking Good Questions

Growing up, Tom Grable always told us the phrase "never to assume" because it makes an `ass` out of `u` and `me`. The True meaning of this phrase is that when you assume something, you are making a decision without any evidence. Without evidence, there is no proof, and inquiry is the core of gathering evidence. This is why asking questions is so important. When you ask a question, you are seeking out evidence that supports the answer to your question. This is why I believe that _asking good questions_ is the most important skill to have in life.

I see peers who struggle with the conception, "I donâ€™t want to be the one asking the DUMB questions" or preface their questions with things like "this may be a dumb question but...". However, more often is the case that when someone asks a question, it is a question that many others have as well. So then was it really a "dumb" question to ask? I think not! If everyone is thinking the same question, then it is a good question to ask because adding clarity to the situation is always a good thing. It also encourages others to ask questions as well because they see that it is okay to ask questions that may seem "dumb" or "obvious", when the reality is that they are not.

## The Elements of a Good Question

What makes us all think to ourselves the first question that comes to mind is a "dumb question" to ask? Well let's look at asking questions and the elements of a Good Question:

### 1. Trust Your Instinct

Sometimes the first question that pops into your mind IS the right question to ask... so ask it!

- The first question that comes to mind is usually _the most obvious question (not the dumbest)_.

### 2. Dig Deeper

Before asking your first question, turn the question into a problem statement. Then break the problem into many smaller questions that are easier to answer yourself.

- For example, ... (example "dumb" question)...

### 3. Try to Answer It Yourself First

After you break your question up into smaller questions, do some research and try to answer as many of them as possible. After filling in as many blanks as you can, you will find that your original question may be resolved, or in fact, there is a better question you should be asking.
