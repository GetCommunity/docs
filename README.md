# Developer Documentation, Guides and Notes

This repository contains a collection of documents, guides and notes that we created over the years. The documents are intended to be a reference for our developers and others. It also contains a collection of code snippets, templates, data files, and other resources that prove to be useful to the Get Community development teams. Thanks to [Joey Grable](https://github.com/joeygrable94) for compiling the initial list of documents and to the huge open source development community for sharing their knowledge and expanding ours.
